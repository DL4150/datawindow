**datawindow** is a comprehensive Python library designed to streamline and simplify the entire data manipulation and analysis workflow. With its intuitive classes and interactive interface, dsmate empowers users to effortlessly handle various data-related tasks, making data preparation, exploration, visualization, and machine learning model creation more accessible than ever before.

## Features:

1. **dfclean: Tackle Data Cleaning with Ease**

   The `dfclean` class offers a powerful solution for managing missing data, handling outliers, scaling features, and categorizing data. Effortlessly preprocess your datasets to ensure they are primed for analysis.

   Syntax Example:
   ```python
   from datawindow import dfclean
   window=dfclean(dataframe)
   clean_df=window.clean()

2. **dfsum: Gain Deeper Insights with Data Summarization**

   Uncover the essence of your data using the `dfsum` class. This functionality allows you to quickly grasp the essential statistics and characteristics of your datasets, facilitating better decision-making.

   **Syntax Example:**

   ```python
   from datawindow import dfsum
   window=dfsum(dataframe) # summarize the dataframe and understand more about it


3. **dfviz: Visualize Data for Enhanced Understanding**
   
   The `dfviz` class empowers you to visualize each column in your dataset through a variety of charts, enabling you to grasp patterns, trends, and correlations with ease. Transform raw data into meaningful insights..

   **Syntax Example:**

   ```python
   from datawindow import dfviz
   window=dfviz(dataframe) # plot the columns of the dataframe 

4. **dfload: Simplified Loading of Large Datasets**
   
   With the `dfload` class, effortlessly load and convert a multitude of files into dataframes. Save time and resources while working with extensive datasets, making the data loading process seamless..

   **Syntax Example:**

   ```python
   from datawindow import dfload
   window=dfload() #only accepts csv and excel files
   dataframes=window.dataframes # get back a list of dataframes selected

5. **ml_model: Effortless Machine Learning Model Creation**
   
   Create and assess machine learning models effortlessly using the `ml_model` class. Gauge the performance of your models with various algorithms, facilitating informed decision-making in your data-driven projects..

   **Syntax Example:**

   ```python
   from datawindow import ml_model
   window=ml_model(X,y,split=0.25,randomness=0,type=0)
   # X- the independent features as dataframe
   # y- dependent or target feature as dataframe
   # split- percentage of how the dataset is split in training and test set; default value is 0.25
   # randomness- how the rows are divided in the dataset, default is 0
   # type- 0 for classification; default value
   #     - 1 for regression
   model=window.model # returns the trained model
